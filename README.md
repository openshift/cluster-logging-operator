# cluster-logging-operator
An operator to support OKD aggregated cluster logging.  Cluster logging configuration information
is found in the [configuration](./docs/configuration.md) documentation.

## Quick Start

To get started with cluster logging and the `cluster-logging-operator`:
* Ensure `docker` is installed on your local system [(**Note** for Fedora 31)](./docs/fedora31.md)
* Ensure `skopeo` is installed, e.g. `sudo dnf install -y skopeo`
```
$ oc login $CLUSTER -u $ADMIN_USER -p $ADMIN_PASSWD
$ REMOTE_CLUSTER=true make deploy-example
```
This will stand up a cluster logging stack named 'example'.


## Hacking

### Building a Universal Base Image (UBI) based image

You must first `oc login api.ci.openshift.org`.  You'll need these credentials in order
to pull images from the UBI registry.

The image build process for UBI based images uses a private yum repo.
In order to use the private yum repo, you will need access to
https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/master/ci-operator/infra/openshift/release-controller/repos/ocp-4.1-default.repo
and
https://github.com/openshift/shared-secrets/blob/master/mirror/ops-mirror.pem
Note that the latter is private and requires special permission to access.

The best approach is to clone these repos under `$GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift`
which the build scripts will pick up automatically.  If you do not, the build script
will attempt to clone them to a temporary directory.

### Running a full integration test with a 4.x cluster

If you have a local clone of [origin-aggregated-logging](https://github.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging)
under `$GOPATH/github.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging` you can use its `hack/get-cluster-run-tests.sh`
to build the logging, elasticsearch-operator, and cluster-logging-operator images; deploy a 4.x cluster;
push the images to the cluster; deploy logging; and launch the logging CI tests.


### Make targets

Make targets use commands such as `oc`, `imagebuilder` and `operator-sdk`.  If a
suitable command is not found in `./bin:$PATH`, `make` will automatically build
or download the command in `./bin`.

See also: [sdk_setup.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/master/hack/sdk_setup.sh) to set up your environment.

#### Targets that do not require a cluster

|Target|Description|
|-----|------------------------------------------|
|`all`|Run all local tests, lint and format code.|
|`lint`|Lint and format code.|
|`test-unit`|Run unit tests.|
|`image`|Build the image but do not deploy it.|

#### Targets that require a cluster

These targets assume:
* Logged into an OKD cluster with cluster role `cluster-admin`
* Clone of `openshift/elasticsearch-operator` repository in `$GOPATH`

The deployment can be optionally modified using any of the following:

| Env Var | Default | Description|
|---------|---------|------------|
|`EXCLUSIONS`|none|The list of manifest files that should will be ignored|
|`PUSH_USER`|none|The name of the user e.g. `kubeadmin` used to push images to the remote registry|
|`PUSH_PASSWORD`|none|The password for `PUSH_USER`|
|`SKIP_BUILD`|false|`true` if you are pushing an image to a remote registry and want to skip building it again|

**Note:** If you do `make deploy-image`, you need a `docker` daemon running
where you are running these commands.  Also ensure you have `podman` (`docker`
may be deprecated in the future). You need to set `PUSH_USER` and
`PUSH_PASSWORD` If you used the `openshift-installer`, it creates a user named
`kubeadmin` with the password in the file
`<install-dir>/auth/kubeadmin_password`.

**Note:**  If while hacking you find your changes are not being applied, use
`docker images` to see if there is a local version of the `cluster-logging-operator`
on your machine which may being used by the cluster instead of the one pushed to
the docker registry.  You may need to delete it (e.g. `docker rmi $IMAGE`)

Some `make` targets to facilitate deployment:

|Target|Description|
|------|-----------|
|`run`| Run controller locally, outside the cluster. |
|`deploy-example`|Deploys all resources and creates an instance of the `cluster-logging-operator`, creates a ClusterLogging custom resource named `example`, starts the Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Fluentd pods running.|
|`deploy`|Deploys all resources and creates an instance of the `cluster-logging-operator`, but does not create the CR nor start the components running.|
|`undeploy`|Removes all `cluster-logging` resources and `openshift-logging` project|
|`deploy-image`|If you already have a remote cluster, and you just want to rebuild and redeploy the image to the remote cluster.|

## Testing

### E2E Testing

This test assumes:
* the cluster-logging-catalog image is available
* the cluster-logging-operator image is available
* the cluster-logging component images are available (i.e. $docker_registry_ip/openshift/$component)

**Note:** This test will fail if the images are not pushed to the cluster
on which the operator runs or can be pulled from a visible registry.

**Note:** It is necessary to set the `IMAGE_CLUSTER_LOGGING_OPERATOR` environment variable to a valid pull spec
in order to run this test against local changes to the `cluster-logging-operator`. For example:
```
$ make deploy-image && IMAGE_CLUSTER_LOGGING_OPERATOR=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/origin-cluster-logging-operator:latest make test-e2e
``**

**Note:** To skip cleanup of resources while hacking/debugging an E2E test apply `DO_CLEANUP=false`.
