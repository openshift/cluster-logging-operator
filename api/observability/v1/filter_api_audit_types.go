import auditv1 "k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/apis/audit/v1"

// KubeAPIAudit filter Kube API server audit logs, as described in [Kubernetes Auditing].
//
// # Policy Filtering
//
// Policy event rules are the same format as the [Kube Audit Policy] with some minor extensions.
// The extensions are described here, see the [Kube Audit Policy] for the standard rule behavior.
// Rules are checked in order, checking stops at the first matching rule.
//
// An audit policy event contains meta-data describing who made the request.
// It can also include the full body of the API request, and the response that was sent.
// The `level` of an audit rule determines how much data is included in the event:
//
//   - None: the event is dropped.
//   - Metadata: Only the audit metadata is included, request and response bodies are removed.
//   - Request: Audit metadata and the request body are included, the response body is removed.
//   - RequestResponse: All data is included: metadata, request body and response body. Note the response body can be very large.
//     For example the a command like `oc get -A pods` generates a response body containing the YAML description of every pod in the cluster.
//
// # Extensions
//
// The following features are extensions to the standard [Kube Audit Policy]
//
// ## Wildcards
//
// Names of users, groups, namespaces, and resources can have a leading or trailing '*' character.
// For example namespace 'openshift-*' matches 'openshift-apiserver' or 'openshift-authentication.
// Resource '*/status' matches 'Pod/status' or 'Deployment/status'
//
// ## Default Rules
//
// Events that do not match any rule in the policy are filtered as follows:
// - User events (ie. non-system and non-serviceaccount) are forwarded
// - Read-only system events (get/list/watch etc) are dropped
// - Service account write events that occur within the same namespace as the service account are dropped
// - All other events are forwarded, subject to any configured [rate limits][#rate-lmiting]
//
// If you want to disable these defaults, end your rules list with rule that has only a `level` field.
// An empty rule matches any event, and prevents the defaults from taking effect.
//
// ## Omit Response Codes
//
// You can drop events based on the HTTP status code in the response. See the OmitResponseCodes field.
