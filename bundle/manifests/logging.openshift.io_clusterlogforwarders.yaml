        description: "ClusterLogForwarder is an API to configure forwarding logs.
          \n You configure forwarding by specifying a list of `pipelines`, which forward
          from a set of named inputs to a set of named outputs. \n There are built-in
          input names for common log categories, and you can define custom inputs
          to do additional filtering. \n There is a built-in output name for the default
          openshift log store, but you can define your own outputs with a URL and
          other connection information to forward logs to other stores or processors,
          inside or outside the cluster. \n For more details see the documentation
          on the API fields."

                        as described in [Kubernetes Auditing]. \n # Policy Filtering
                        \n Policy event rules are the same format as the [Kube Audit
                        Policy] with some minor extensions. The extensions are described
                        here, see the [Kube Audit Policy] for the standard rule behavior.
                        Rules are checked in order, checking stops at the first matching
                        rule. \n An audit policy event contains meta-data describing
                        who made the request. It can also include the full body of
                        the API request, and the response that was sent. The `level`
                        of an audit rule determines how much data is included in the
                        event: \n - None: the event is dropped. - Metadata: Only the
                        audit metadata is included, request and response bodies are
                        removed. - Request: Audit metadata and the request body are
                        included, the response body is removed. - RequestResponse:
                        All data is included: metadata, request body and response
                        body. Note the response body can be very large. For example
                        the a command like `oc list -A pods` generates a response
                        body containing the YAML description of every pod in the cluster.
                        \n # Extensions \n The following features are extensions to
                        the standard [Kube Audit Policy] \n ## Wildcards \n Names
                        of users, groups, namespaces, and resources can have a leading
                        or trailing '*' character. For example namespace 'openshift-*'
                        matches 'openshift-apiserver' or 'openshift-authentication.
                        Resource '*/status' matches 'Pod/status' or 'Deployment/status'
                        \n ## Default Rules \n Events that do not match any rule in
                        the policy are filtered as follows: - User events (ie. non-system
                        and non-serviceaccount) are forwarded - Read-only system events
                        (get/list/watch etc) are dropped - Service account write events
                        that occur within the same namespace as the service account
                        are dropped - All other events are forwarded, subject to any
                        configured [rate limits][#rate-lmiting] \n If you want to
                        disable these defaults, end your rules list with rule that
                        has only a `level` field. An empty rule matches any event,
                        and prevents the defaults from taking effect. \n ## Omit Response
                        Codes \n You can drop events based on the HTTP status code
                        in the response. See the OmitResponseCodes field. \n [Kube
