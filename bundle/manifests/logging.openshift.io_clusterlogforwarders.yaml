          \n You configure forwarding by specifying a list of `pipelines`, which forward
          from a set of named inputs to a set of named outputs. \n There are built-in
          input names for common log categories, and you can define custom inputs
          to do additional filtering. \n There is a built-in output name for the default
          openshift log store, but you can define your own outputs with a URL and
          other connection information to forward logs to other stores or processors,
          inside or outside the cluster. \n For more details see the documentation

                        and the values are base64-encoded binary data, for example
                        TLS certificates. \n Common keys are described here. Some
                        output types support additional keys, documented with the
                        output-specific configuration field. All secret keys are optional,

                        keys. \n Transport Layer Security (TLS) \n Using a TLS URL
                        ('https://...' or 'tls://...') without any secret enables
                        basic TLS: client authenticates server using system default
                        certificate authority. \n Additional TLS features are enabled
                        by referencing a Secret with the following optional fields
                        in its spec.data. All data fields are base64 encoded. \n `tls.crt`:
                        A client certificate, for mutual authentication. Requires
                        `tls.key`. `tls.key`: Private key to unlock the client certificate.
                        Requires `tls.crt` `passphrase`: Passphrase to decode an encoded
                        TLS private key. Requires tls.key. `ca-bundle.crt`: Custom
                        CA to validate certificates. \n Username and Password \n `username`:
                        Authentication user name. Requires `password`. `password`:
                        Authentication password. Requires `username`. \n Simple Authentication
                        Security Layer (SASL) \n `sasl.enable`: (boolean) Explicitly
                        enable or disable SASL. If missing, SASL is automatically
                        enabled if any `sasl.*` keys are set. `sasl.mechanisms`: (array
                        of string) List of allowed SASL mechanism names. If missing
                        or empty, the system defaults are used. `sasl.allow-insecure`:
                        (boolean) Allow mechanisms that send clear-text passwords.
