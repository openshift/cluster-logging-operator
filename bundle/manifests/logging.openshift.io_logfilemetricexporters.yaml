                  properties:

                      description: |-
                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                    Condition represents an observation of an object's state. Conditions are an
                    extension mechanism intended to be used when the details of an observation
                    are not a priori known or would not apply to all instances of a given Kind.


                    Conditions should be added to explicitly convey properties that users and
                    components care about rather than requiring those properties to be inferred
                    from other observations. Once defined, the meaning of a Condition can not be
                    changed arbitrarily - it becomes part of the API, and has the same
                    backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of any other part of the API.

                        Condition types should indicate state in the "abnormal-true" polarity. For
                        example, if the condition indicates when a policy is invalid, the "is valid"
                        case is probably the norm, so the condition should be called "Invalid".
