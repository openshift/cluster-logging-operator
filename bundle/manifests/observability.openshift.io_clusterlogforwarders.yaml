                        as described in [Kubernetes Auditing]. \n # Policy Filtering
                        \n Policy event rules are the same format as the [Kube Audit
                        Policy] with some minor extensions. The extensions are described
                        here, see the [Kube Audit Policy] for the standard rule behavior.
                        Rules are checked in order, checking stops at the first matching
                        rule. \n An audit policy event contains meta-data describing
                        who made the request. It can also include the full body of
                        the API request, and the response that was sent. The `level`
                        of an audit rule determines how much data is included in the
                        event: \n - None: the event is dropped. - Metadata: Only the
                        audit metadata is included, request and response bodies are
                        removed. - Request: Audit metadata and the request body are
                        included, the response body is removed. - RequestResponse:
                        All data is included: metadata, request body and response
                        body. Note the response body can be very large. For example
                        the a command like `oc get -A pods` generates a response body
                        containing the YAML description of every pod in the cluster.
                        \n # Extensions \n The following features are extensions to
                        the standard [Kube Audit Policy] \n ## Wildcards \n Names
                        of users, groups, namespaces, and resources can have a leading
                        or trailing '*' character. For example namespace 'openshift-*'
                        matches 'openshift-apiserver' or 'openshift-authentication.
                        Resource '*/status' matches 'Pod/status' or 'Deployment/status'
                        \n ## Default Rules \n Events that do not match any rule in
                        the policy are filtered as follows: - User events (ie. non-system
                        and non-serviceaccount) are forwarded - Read-only system events
                        (get/list/watch etc) are dropped - Service account write events
                        that occur within the same namespace as the service account
                        are dropped - All other events are forwarded, subject to any
                        configured [rate limits][#rate-lmiting] \n If you want to
                        disable these defaults, end your rules list with rule that
                        has only a `level` field. An empty rule matches any event,
                        and prevents the defaults from taking effect. \n ## Omit Response
                        Codes \n You can drop events based on the HTTP status code
                        in the response. See the OmitResponseCodes field. \n [Kube
