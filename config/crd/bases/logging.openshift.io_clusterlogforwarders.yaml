        description: "ClusterLogForwarder is an API to configure forwarding logs.
          \n You configure forwarding by specifying a list of `pipelines`, which forward
          from a set of named inputs to a set of named outputs. \n There are built-in
          input names for common log categories, and you can define custom inputs
          to do additional filtering. \n There is a built-in output name for the default
          openshift log store, but you can define your own outputs with a URL and
          other connection information to forward logs to other stores or processors,
          inside or outside the cluster. \n For more details see the documentation
          on the API fields."

                        authentication information is stored in a separate Secret
                        object. A Secret is like a ConfigMap, where the keys are strings
                        and the values are base64-encoded binary data, for example
                        TLS certificates. \n Common keys are described here. Some
                        output types support additional keys, documented with the
                        output-specific configuration field. All secret keys are optional,

                        keys. \n Transport Layer Security (TLS) \n Using a TLS URL
                        ('https://...' or 'tls://...') without any secret enables
                        basic TLS: client authenticates server using system default
                        certificate authority. \n Additional TLS features are enabled
                        by referencing a Secret with the following optional fields
                        in its spec.data. All data fields are base64 encoded. \n `tls.crt`:
                        A client certificate, for mutual authentication. Requires
                        `tls.key`. `tls.key`: Private key to unlock the client certificate.
                        Requires `tls.crt` `passphrase`: Passphrase to decode an encoded
                        TLS private key. Requires tls.key. `ca-bundle.crt`: Custom
                        CA to validate certificates. \n `tls.insecure`: If this key
                        is present (with any value) accept server certificates that
                        are self-signed or have an incorrect hostname. This is INSECURE,
                        the connection is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
                        This is ONLY for development and testing when valid certificates
                        are not available. \n Username and Password \n `username`:
                        Authentication user name. Requires `password`. `password`:
                        Authentication password. Requires `username`. \n Simple Authentication
                        Security Layer (SASL) \n `sasl.enable`: (boolean) Explicitly
                        enable or disable SASL. If missing, SASL is automatically
                        enabled if any `sasl.*` keys are set. `sasl.mechanisms`: (array
                        of string) List of allowed SASL mechanism names. If missing
                        or empty, the system defaults are used. `sasl.allow-insecure`:
