# Overview of the cluster logging operator

This README gives an overview of the Cluster Logging Operator, what it does and how it works.

You can install official Red Hat releases using the "operartor hub" section of your cluster console. The [Red Hat Documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html) describes those released versions.

To build and deploy the operator for yourself from source see [Hacking on the Cluster Logging Operator](HACKING.md)
