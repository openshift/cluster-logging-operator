= Collecting Container Log Metrics

The cluster logging solution distributes a component called the "Log File Metrics Exporter" that enables a Prometheus metrics endpoint.
It is deployed as a daemonset on the cluster to gather metrics about the volume of logs being produced by container workloads on a cluster.

== Deployment

A link:../reference/operator/api_logging_v1alpha1.adoc[LogFileMetricsExporter] is deployed separately as part of link:clusterlogforwarder.adoc[Multi ClusterLogForwarder] by creating a LogFileMetricsExporter object.  For example:

.LogFileMetricsExporter Example
[source]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "LogFileMetricExporter"
metadata:
  name: "instance"
  namespace: "openshift-logging"
spec:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "500m"
    requests:
      cpu: "200m"
      memory: "128Mi"
----

NOTE: The operator will only reconcile an object named 'instance' in the 'openshift-logging' namespace
