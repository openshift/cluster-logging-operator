This site provides:

* High-level overview of the cluster logging architecture.
* Summary of work in progress on the design of future enhancments.
* Links to further details.

TIP: This site is evolving, it will be updated as plans and architecture change.

The link:..[source for this site] is versioned with the Cluster Logging
Operator source code. The goal is to keep it current with the code. 
These pages can be updated by the same PR process as source code.
