= API Audit Filter

Each call to the Kube or OpenShift API server generates an audit event containing  the request, response and details of who made the call.
These events are important for security audits, but can contain more information than is normally needed.
This can make the volume of data unmanageable for many applications.

The API Audit filter allows you to remove unwanted events and reduce event size to create a manageable audit trail.

== Using the API Audit Filter

Audit policy is explained, with examples, in https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/#audit-policy[Auditing Kubernetes].

The ClusterLogForwarder audit filter also has some features that are extensions to the standard policy, see
link:../../../../apis/observability/v1/filter_api_audit_types.go[the API documentation].

Here is an example of a ClusterLogForwarder configuration using the example policy from
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/#audit-policy[Auditing Kubernetes].
Note this example is _not_ a recommended audit policy, it is only intended to show the range of audit policy rules.

== Differences from OCP audit log policy

The OCP (Openshift Container Platform) provides a resource to configure the audit log policy of its API servers.
This resource is different to the ClusterLogForwarder filter, and less flexible.
For more details see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/audit-log-policy-config.html

The OCP policy only allows control of events by `group`
It does not allow you to distinguish events by `verb`, which is important to separate more important "update" events from less important "read only" events.

The ClusterLogForwarder filter provides control by verb, user, group, namespace, resource and more.

The OCP policy changes what events the API server _emits_, there can only be one such policy per cluster.
Changing the policy may require permissions that are not available to the customer admin of a managed cluster.

The ClusterLogForwarder filter changes what the log collector _forwards_.
You can create multiple filters to send different summaries of the same audit stream to different places.
For example, you could send a detailed stream to the local cluster log store, and a less detailed stream at a remote site.
Changing the filter requires normal admin access to the ClusterLogForwarder.
