= Prune Filter

Collecting all logs from a cluster produces a large amount of data, which can be expensive to transport and store. A lot of log data is low-value noise that does not need to be stored.

The prune filter allows for pruning log record fields to reduce the size of logs flowing into a log store.

== Configuring and Using a Prune Filter

A `prune` filter removes fields from each record passing through the filter.

The prune filter extends the filter API by adding a `prune` field and the `in`, and `notIn` fields nested underneath. Both `in` and `notIn` fields are an array of dot-delimited field paths.

=== Definitions:
* `in`: Prune fields from the log record that match paths defined in the array.
* `notIn`: Prune all fields from the log record that do not match paths defined in the array.
* Dot-delimited field path: A path to a field in the log record. It must start with a dot (`.`). The path can contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores `(a-zA-Z0-9_)`. If segments contain characters outside of this range, the segment must be quoted.
** Examples: `.kubernetes.namespace_name`, `.log_type`, `.kubernetes.labels.foobar`, `.kubernetes.labels."foo-bar/baz"`

.Note #1
[NOTE] 
`notIn` takes precedence over `in`. That is, if both `in` and `notIn` are specified, vector will initially prune fields **NOT** listed in the `notIn` list followed by pruning fields specified in the `in` list.

.Note #2
[NOTE]
`in` **CANNOT** contain `.log_type` or `.message` as those fields are required and cannot be pruned. Additionally if this filter is used in a pipeline with `GoogleCloudLogging`, `.hostname` **CANNOT** be added to the `in` list as it is also a required field.

.Note #3
[NOTE]
`notIn` **MUST** contain `.log_type` and `.message` as those fields are required and cannot be pruned. Additionally if this filter is used in a pipeline with `GoogleCloudLogging`, `.hostname` **MUST** be added to the `notIn` list as it is also a required field.

=== Example:

Below is an example `ClusterLogForwarder` configuration specifying a custom prune filter called `my-prune`.
