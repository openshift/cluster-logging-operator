== DetectMultilineErrors
Enables multi-line error detection of container logs.

*Please be aware* that enabling this feature could have performance implications and may require additional computing resources or alternate logging solutions.

=== Problem
Log parsers often incorrectly identify separate lines of the same exception as separate exceptions.
This leads to extra log entries and an incomplete or inaccurate view of the traced information.

.example java exception
[,text]
----
java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "String.toString()" because "<param1>" is null
    at testjava.Main.handle(Main.java:47)
    at testjava.Main.printMe(Main.java:19)
    at testjava.Main.main(Main.java:10)
----

=== Solution
Include `detectMultilineException` filter when you create your Cluster Log Forwarder.
Openshift Logging will detect multi-line exceptions and reassemble them into a single log entry.

.cluster-log-forwarder.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  filters:
  - name: detectMultilineException
    type: detectMultilineException
  pipelines:
    - name: my-app-logs
      inputRefs:
      - application
      outputRefs:
      - anOutput
      filterRefs:
      - detectMultilineError
----

=== Details
When a consecutive sequence of log messages forms an exception stack trace, the log messages are combined into a single, unified log record.
The content of the message field of the first log message is replaced with the concatenated content of all the message fields in the sequence.

.Supported languages per collector:
|===
|Language | 

|Java |
|JS |
|Ruby | 
|Python | 
|Golang | 
|PHP | 
|Dart | 
|===

=== Troubleshooting
When enabled, the collector configuration will include a new section with type: `detect_exceptions`

.vector config section example
----
[transforms.detect_exceptions_app-logs]
 type = "detect_exceptions"
 inputs = ["application"]
 languages = ["All"]
 group_by = ["kubernetes.namespace_name","kubernetes.pod_name","kubernetes.container_name"]
 expire_after_ms = 2000
 multiline_flush_interval_ms = 1000
----

=== Extended support

Supporting new languages or custom formats requires new detection rules and additional feature changes.

The rules currently in use are located in *detect_exceptions* transform in the *ViaQ/Vector* repository on github.
