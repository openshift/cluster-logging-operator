== Steps to forward to Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC)

More information about format of Splunk HTTP Event you can read in this document:
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/FormateventsforHTTPEventCollector[Format events for HTTP Event Collector]

. Create a secret containing your `hecToken` using the following command:
+
----
 oc create secret generic splunk-secret -n openshift-logging --from-literal=hecToken='<hec_token_here>'
----

. Create a Cluster Log Forwarder instance by specifying your `url` and the `secret` name:
+
----
 oc apply -f cluster-log-forwarder.yaml
----
+
.cluster-log-forwarder.yaml
[source,yaml]

1. `token`: Points to the secret containing the Splunk HEC token used for authenticating requests.
2. `url`: The base URL of the Splunk instance.
3. `index`: Optional. The name of the index to send events to. If not specified, the default index defined within Splunk is used. This supports template syntax to allow dynamic per-event values.
4. `source`: Optional. The source of events sent to this sink. This supports template syntax to allow dynamic per-event values.
5. `indexedFields`: Optional. Fields to be added to Splunk index.
6. `payloadKey`: Optional. Specifies record field to use as payload.
7. `compression`: Optional. Compression configuration, available to are: `none`, `gzip`. Default is `none`.

=== `source`
In Splunk, the `source` field typically identifies the origin of a log event.
To ensure consistency and meaningful categorization, the `source` value can be dynamically derived from the `log_type` and `log_source` fields,
following Cluster Log Forwarder's conventions.

=== `indexedFields`

In Splunk, `indexed_fields` are fields that are extracted at *index time*, rather than at *search time*. This means their values are stored directly in the index alongside the raw event data, allowing for *faster search performance* on those fields.

However, because `indexed_fields` increase storage usage, they should be used *sparingly* and only for *high-value fields* that provide significant search benefits.

Since logs processed by Vector are typically *well-structured JSON*, Splunk can dynamically extract fields at search time. As a result, the use of `indexed_fields` is *not necessary by default*. That said, they may be valuable in *specific use cases*, such as *large datasets with frequent queries on specific fields*.
In such cases, users can configure the required fields manually.

==== Indexed Fields Transformation Rules

To support the use of complex and nested fields as indexed fields, field names and values are automatically transformed to meet requirements:

* Nested fields are flattened into top-level fields.
* Field paths are joined using dot notation, and unsupported characters are replaced with underscores (`_`).
* Non-string values are automatically converted to strings (e.g., `3` → `"3"`, `true` → `"true"`).
* Object values are serialized as JSON strings (e.g., `{ status: 200 }` → `"{\"status\":200}"`).

These transformations allow for flexible field selection without requiring changes to the original log structure.

=== Examples

==== Example 1: Nested key

ClusterLogForwarder configuration:
[source,yaml]
----
indexedFields: [".annotations.authorization.k8s.io/decision", ".annotations.authorization.k8s.io/reason"]
----

Original log structure:
[source,json]
----
"annotations": {
  "authorization.k8s.io/decision": "allow",
  "authorization.k8s.io/reason": "foo_bar"
}
----

Transformed fields:
[source,json]
----
"annotations_authorization_k8s_io_decision": "allow",
"annotations_authorization_k8s_io_reason": "foo_bar"
----

==== Example 2: Numeric and Boolean Values

ClusterLogForwarder configuration:
[source,yaml]
----
indexedFields: [".status_code", ".success"]
----

Original log structure:
[source,json]
----
"status_code": 200,
"success": true
----

Transformed fields:
[source,json]
----
"status_code": "200",
"success": "true"
----

==== Example 3: Embedded Object

ClusterLogForwarder configuration:
[source,yaml]
----
indexedFields: [".objectRef.resource"]
----

Original log structure:
[source,json]
----
"objectRef": {
  "resource": {
    "status": 200,
    "statusText": "OK"
  }
}
----

Transformed field:
[source,json]
----
"objectRef_resource": "{\"status\":200,\"statusText\":\"OK\"}"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
After remapping, the *original fields* will be removed to avoid duplication.
Only the transformed, top-level fields will be retained in the final log event.
====

=== `payloadKey`

By default, `payloadKey` is not set, which means the complete log record is forwarded as the payload.


NOTE: Use `payloadKey` carefully. Selecting a single field as the payload may cause other important information in the log to be dropped, potentially leading to inconsistent or incomplete log events.


=== `sourceType` and `host`

The `sourceType` and `host` fields are *not configurable* through the Cluster Log Forwarder API. They are set automatically as described below, independent of the `.log_type` or `.log_source` values.

* `sourceType`:
Determined automatically based on the type of the final event payload.
** `_json` — used when `payloadKey` is not set or when `payloadKey` points to an object.
** `generic_single_line` — when the payload is a primitive value (e.g., string, number, boolean).

* `host`: Set to the value of `.hostname`
This ensures that each log event carries the correct *originating host* information.

== Default settings
Below the table with default value depends on log_type and log_source will be used if not set in configuration.
