=== Receiving logs over HTTP

You can receive logs from outside the cluster over HTTP by creating an HTTP `source` and associating it with an input.
For example, to receive audit logs over HTTP:

.http-intput.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
 inputs:
   - name: my-http-logs
     source: my-http-source

 sources:
   name: my-http-source
   http:
     port: 12345
