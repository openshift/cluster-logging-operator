== https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3270[LOG-3270]: OCP Cluster-wide Cryptographic Policies and Output Crypto Configuration

This feature makes collector deployments comply with the OCP cryptographic policy that is defined for
the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/rest_api/config_apis/apiserver-config-openshift-io-v1.html[cluster] config settings.
Additionally, this feature enables administrators to define a TLS profile to be used when forwarding
logs to different outputs.

TLS profiles are configurable for each output. Profiles
are applied according to the following order of precedence:

. Output Spec
. Cluster-wide Config

.Enable TLS Security Profile feature
