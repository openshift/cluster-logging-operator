== ClusterLogForwarder

ClusterLogForwarder is an API to configure forwarding logs.

You configure forwarding by specifying a list of `pipelines`,
which forward from a set of named inputs to a set of named outputs.

=== .spec.filters[].kubeAPIAudit

KubeAPIAudit filter Kube API server audit logs, as described in [Kubernetes Auditing].

# Policy Filtering

Policy event rules are the same format as the [Kube Audit Policy] with some minor extensions.
The extensions are described here, see the [Kube Audit Policy] for the standard rule behavior.
Rules are checked in order, checking stops at the first matching rule.

An audit policy event contains meta-data describing who made the request.
It can also include the full body of the API request, and the response that was sent.
The `level` of an audit rule determines how much data is included in the event:

- None: the event is dropped.

- Metadata: Only the audit metadata is included, request and response bodies are removed.

- Request: Audit metadata and the request body are included, the response body is removed.

- RequestResponse: All data is included: metadata, request body and response body. Note the response body can be very large.

For example the a command like `oc get -A pods` generates a response body containing the YAML description of every pod in the cluster.

# Extensions

The following features are extensions to the standard [Kube Audit Policy]

## Wildcards

Names of users, groups, namespaces, and resources can have a leading or trailing &#39;*&#39; character.
For example namespace &#39;openshift-*&#39; matches &#39;openshift-apiserver&#39; or &#39;openshift-authentication.
Resource &#39;*/status&#39; matches &#39;Pod/status&#39; or &#39;Deployment/status&#39;

Events which include both a &#39;resource&#39; and &#39;subresource&#39; are evaluated by combing those
fields with a forward slash.  This means rules that rely upon a resource type that may or
may not include the subresource should be adjusted to cover all the required use-cases (i.e. [&#39;pod&#39;,&#39;pod/*&#39;]).

## Default Rules

Events that do not match any rule in the policy are filtered as follows:
- User events (ie. non-system and non-serviceaccount) are forwarded
- Read-only system events (get/list/watch etc) are dropped
- Service account write events that occur within the same namespace as the service account are dropped
- All other events are forwarded, subject to any configured [rate limits][#rate-lmiting]

If you want to disable these defaults, end your rules list with rule that has only a `level` field.
An empty rule matches any event, and prevents the defaults from taking effect.

## Omit Response Codes

You can drop events based on the HTTP status code in the response. See the OmitResponseCodes field.

[Kube Audit Policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/apiserver-audit.v1/#audit-k8s-io-v1-Policy

|omitResponseCodes|int|  OmitResponseCodes is a list of HTTP status code for which no events are created.
If this field is missing or null, the default value used is [404, 409, 422, 429]
(NotFound, Conflict, UnprocessableEntity, TooManyRequests)
If it is the empty list [], then no status codes are omitted.
Otherwise, this field should be a list of integer status codes to omit.

|omitStages|array|  OmitStages is a list of stages for which no events are created.
Note that this can also be specified per rule in which case the union of both are omitted.

|rules|array|  Rules specify the audit Level a request should be recorded at.
A request may match multiple rules, in which case the FIRST matching rule is used.
PolicyRules are strictly ordered.

|omitManagedFields|bool|  *(optional)* OmitManagedFields indicates whether to omit the managed fields of the request
and response bodies from being written to the API audit log.
- a value of &#39;true&#39; will drop the managed fields from the API audit log
- a value of &#39;false&#39; indicates that the managed fileds should be included

in the API audit log
Note that the value, if specified, in this rule will override the global default
If a value is not specified then the global default specified in
Policy.OmitManagedFields will stand.
|omitStages|array|  *(optional)* OmitStages is a list of stages for which no events are created. Note that this can also
be specified policy wide in which case the union of both are omitted.
An empty list means no restrictions will apply.
|resources|array|  *(optional)* Resources that this rule matches. An empty list implies all kinds in all API groups.
|userGroups|array|  *(optional)* The user groups this rule applies to. A user is considered matching
if it is a member of any of the UserGroups.

An empty list implies that every instance of the resource is matched.
|resources|array|  *(optional)* Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.

For example:
- `pods` matches pods.
- `pods/log` matches the log subresource of pods.
- `*` matches all resources and their subresources.
- `pods/*` matches all subresources of pods.
- `*/scale` matches all scale subresources.

If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not
overlap with each other.

One additional label &#34;kubernetes_host&#34; is not part of the label keys configuration. It contains the hostname
where the collector is running and is always present.

Note: Loki label names must match the regular expression &#34;[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*&#34;
Log record keys may contain characters like &#34;.&#34; and &#34;/&#34; that are not allowed in Loki labels.
Log record keys are translated to Loki labels by replacing any illegal characters with &#39;_&#39;.

For example the default log record keys translate to these Loki labels:

- log_type

- kubernetes_container_name

- kubernetes_namespace_name

- kubernetes_pod_name

Note: the set of labels should be small, Loki imposes limits on the size and number of labels allowed.

A dynamic value is encased in single curly brackets `{}` and MUST end with a static fallback value separated with `||`.

Static values can only contain alphanumeric characters along with dashes, underscores, dots and forward slashes.

Example:

1. foo-{.bar||&#34;none&#34;}

2. {.foo||.bar||&#34;missing&#34;}

3. foo.{.bar.baz||.qux.quux.corge||.grault||&#34;nil&#34;}-waldo.fred{.plugh||&#34;none&#34;}

|indexedFields|array|  IndexedFields are the list of fields to be indexed by Splunk, increase storage usage, they should be used sparingly and only for high-value fields that provide significant search benefits.
Nested fields are flattened into top-level fields.
Field paths are joined using dot notation, and unsupported characters are replaced with underscores (_).
Non-string values are automatically converted to strings (e.g., 3 → &#34;3&#34;, true → &#34;true&#34;).
Object values serialized as JSON strings (e.g., { status: 200 } → &#34;{\&#34;status\&#34;:200}&#34;).

Examples: [`.kubernetes`, `.log_type`, &#39;.kubernetes.labels.foobar&#39;, `.kubernetes.labels.&#34;foo-bar/baz&#34;`]
|payloadKey|string|  PayloadKey specifies record field to use as payload.
The PayloadKey must be a single field path.

Field paths must only contain alphanumeric and underscores. Any field with other characters must be quoted.

By default, payloadKey is not set, which means the complete log record is forwarded as the payload.
Use payloadKey carefully. Selecting a single field as the payload may cause other important information in the
log to be dropped, potentially leading to inconsistent or incomplete log events.

Examples: `.kubernetes`, `.log_type`, &#39;.kubernetes.labels.foobar&#39;, `.kubernetes.labels.&#34;foo-bar/baz&#34;`

|source|string|  Source identifies the origin of a log event.
The Source can be a combination of static and dynamic values consisting of field paths followed by `||` followed by another field path or a static value.
A dynamic value is encased in single curly brackets `{}` and MUST end with a static fallback value separated with `||`.
Static values can only contain alphanumeric characters along with dashes, underscores, dots and forward slashes.
If not specified will be detected according to .log_source and .log_type value.
Details see in: docs/features/logforwarding/outputs/splunk-forwarding.adoc

Example:

1. foo-{.bar||&#34;none&#34;}

2. {.foo||.bar||&#34;missing&#34;}

3. foo.{.bar.baz||.qux.quux.corge||.grault||&#34;nil&#34;}-waldo.fred{.plugh||&#34;none&#34;}

|type|string|  *(optional)* type is one of Old, Intermediate, Modern or Custom. Custom provides
the ability to specify individual TLS security profile parameters.
Old, Intermediate and Modern are TLS security profiles based on:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations

The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers
are found to be insecure.  Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be
reduced.

Note that the Modern profile is currently not supported because it is not
yet well adopted by common software libraries.
