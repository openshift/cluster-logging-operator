== ClusterLogForwarder

ClusterLogForwarder is an API to configure forwarding logs.

You configure forwarding by specifying a list of `pipelines`,
which forward from a set of named inputs to a set of named outputs.

of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and

=== .spec.filters[].kubeAPIAudit

KubeAPIAudit filter Kube API server audit logs, as described in [Kubernetes Auditing].

# Policy Filtering

Policy event rules are the same format as the [Kube Audit Policy] with some minor extensions.
The extensions are described here, see the [Kube Audit Policy] for the standard rule behavior.
Rules are checked in order, checking stops at the first matching rule.

An audit policy event contains meta-data describing who made the request.
It can also include the full body of the API request, and the response that was sent.
The `level` of an audit rule determines how much data is included in the event:

- None: the event is dropped.

- Metadata: Only the audit metadata is included, request and response bodies are removed.

- Request: Audit metadata and the request body are included, the response body is removed.

- RequestResponse: All data is included: metadata, request body and response body. Note the response body can be very large.

For example the a command like `oc get -A pods` generates a response body containing the YAML description of every pod in the cluster.

# Extensions

The following features are extensions to the standard [Kube Audit Policy]

## Wildcards

Names of users, groups, namespaces, and resources can have a leading or trailing &#39;*&#39; character.
For example namespace &#39;openshift-*&#39; matches &#39;openshift-apiserver&#39; or &#39;openshift-authentication.
Resource &#39;*/status&#39; matches &#39;Pod/status&#39; or &#39;Deployment/status&#39;

## Default Rules

Events that do not match any rule in the policy are filtered as follows:
- User events (ie. non-system and non-serviceaccount) are forwarded
- Read-only system events (get/list/watch etc) are dropped
- Service account write events that occur within the same namespace as the service account are dropped
- All other events are forwarded, subject to any configured [rate limits][#rate-lmiting]

If you want to disable these defaults, end your rules list with rule that has only a `level` field.
An empty rule matches any event, and prevents the defaults from taking effect.

## Omit Response Codes

You can drop events based on the HTTP status code in the response. See the OmitResponseCodes field.

[Kube Audit Policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/apiserver-audit.v1/#audit-k8s-io-v1-Policy

|omitResponseCodes|int|  OmitResponseCodes is a list of HTTP status code for which no events are created.
If this field is missing or null, the default value used is [404, 409, 422, 429]
(NotFound, Conflict, UnprocessableEntity, TooManyRequests)
If it is the empty list [], then no status codes are omitted.
Otherwise, this field should be a list of integer status codes to omit.

|omitStages|array|  OmitStages is a list of stages for which no events are created.
Note that this can also be specified per rule in which case the union of both are omitted.

|rules|array|  Rules specify the audit Level a request should be recorded at.
A request may match multiple rules, in which case the FIRST matching rule is used.
PolicyRules are strictly ordered.

If Rules is empty or missing default rules apply, see [KubeAPIAudit]

|omitManagedFields|bool|  *(optional)* OmitManagedFields indicates whether to omit the managed fields of the request
and response bodies from being written to the API audit log.
- a value of &#39;true&#39; will drop the managed fields from the API audit log
- a value of &#39;false&#39; indicates that the managed fileds should be included

in the API audit log
Note that the value, if specified, in this rule will override the global default
If a value is not specified then the global default specified in
Policy.OmitManagedFields will stand.
|omitStages|array|  *(optional)* OmitStages is a list of stages for which no events are created. Note that this can also
be specified policy wide in which case the union of both are omitted.
An empty list means no restrictions will apply.
|resources|array|  *(optional)* Resources that this rule matches. An empty list implies all kinds in all API groups.
|userGroups|array|  *(optional)* The user groups this rule applies to. A user is considered matching
if it is a member of any of the UserGroups.

Using this field requires Resources to be specified.
An empty list implies that every instance of the resource is matched.
|resources|array|  *(optional)* Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.

For example:
- `pods` matches pods.
- `pods/log` matches the log subresource of pods.
- `*` matches all resources and their subresources.
- `pods/*` matches all subresources of pods.
- `*/scale` matches all scale subresources.

If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not
overlap with each other.

An empty list implies all resources and subresources in this API groups apply.

If LabelKeys is not set, the default keys are:

- log_type

- kubernetes.container_name

- kubernetes.namespace_name

- kubernetes.pod_name

One additional label &#34;kubernetes_host&#34; is not part of the label keys configuration. It contains the hostname
where the collector is running and is always present.

Note: Loki label names must match the regular expression &#34;[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*&#34;
Log record keys may contain characters like &#34;.&#34; and &#34;/&#34; that are not allowed in Loki labels.
Log record keys are translated to Loki labels by replacing any illegal characters with &#39;_&#39;.

For example the default log record keys translate to these Loki labels:

- log_type

- kubernetes_container_name

- kubernetes_namespace_name

- kubernetes_pod_name

Note: the set of labels should be small, Loki imposes limits on the size and number of labels allowed.
See https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configuration/#limits_config for more.
Loki queries can also query based on any log record field (not just labels) using query filters.

|tenantKey|string|  TenantKey is the tenant for the logs. This supports vector&#39;s template syntax to allow dynamic per-event values.

The TenantKey can be a combination of static and dynamic values consisting of field paths followed by `||` followed by another field path or a static value.

the ability to specify individual TLS security profile parameters.
Old, Intermediate and Modern are TLS security profiles based on:

The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers
are found to be insecure.  Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be
reduced.

Note that the Modern profile is currently not supported because it is not
yet well adopted by common software libraries.

|status|string|  status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.
|type|string|  type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.

Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)

|Property|Type|Description

|lastTransitionTime|string|  lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
|message|string|  message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
This may be an empty string.
|observedGeneration|int|  *(optional)* observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
with respect to the current state of the instance.
|reason|string|  reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition&#39;s last transition.
Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
The value should be a CamelCase string.
This field may not be empty.
|status|string|  status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.
|type|string|  type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
